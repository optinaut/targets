# MOA & MRAD TARGETS
If you have access to a printer, you can print your own MOA or MRAD targets.

Paper sizes available:
  - 11" x 17"
  - Legal (8-1/2" x 14")
  - Letter (8-1/2" x 11"

Target Scales:
  - MOA targets are scaled to 1-MOA at 100 yards, using a unit of 1.047 inches.
  - MRAD targets are scaled to 1-MRAD at 100 meters, using a unit of 1 centimeter.

Printing:
  When printing these targets, make sure that you print to 'actual size', not 'fit' or 'shrink oversized pages'.  This will ensure that
  that the targets are printed 'to scale', and not resized.
